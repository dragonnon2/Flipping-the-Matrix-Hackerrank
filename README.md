How to actual flip the matrix and not just using "Group" to find max for each group

Hi, I'm new to coding and Github. It take me 2 whole day to write this code, fix all bug and generalize the code to more than 4x4. 

For using group part to find max, there are a lot of people explain this. I also learn from them and you can google to find picture for better visualization.

For the actual rotate part, you can visualize it as "Rubik" cube that you can rotate the current row and desire row to make both row another direction and not affect any other row then rotate the column to swap them so you get the desire row then rotate back.

Then I apply this logic into coding and there it is the code in my Github.

If there is anything you want to suggest, feel free to do guys. I'm still learning and learning. ^-^
